# CIAB-Mesh-VPN-Wireguard-FRR-BGP-VXLAN-Internet-Overlay

The Cloud In A Box project now includes what we describes as the 
CIAB Full Mesh VPN Internet Overlay Implemented using all Open Source 
tools and applications:   
  
- Linux (I use Ubuntu)
- Wireguard  
- Free Range Routing (FRR)  
- BGP and BGP-VRFs  
- VXLAN   
- and LXD VMs and Containers  
  
The Cloud in a Box (CIAB) Mesh VPN is a software-defined wide-area network that is
abstracted from hardware, creating a virtualized network overlay.
