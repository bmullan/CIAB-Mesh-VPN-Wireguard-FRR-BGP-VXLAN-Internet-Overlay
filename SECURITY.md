# Security Issue Policy

If you uncover a security issue with CIAB, please write to <bmullan@gmail.com>.
Please encrypt sensitive information using the [PGP key](PGP-KEY.asc).

Once the CIAB maintainer becomes aware (or are made
aware) of a security issue, they will immediately assess it. Based on impact and
complexity, they will determine an embargo period (if externally reported, the
period will be agreed upon with the external party).

During the embargo period, maintainers will prioritize developing a fix over
other activities. Within this period, maintainers may also notify a limited
number of trusted parties via a pre-disclosure list, providing them with
technical information, a risk assessment, and early access to a fix.

The external users are included in this group based on the scale of their
CIAB usage and/or code-contributions. The pre-disclosure list may also contain
significant external security contributors that can join the effort to fix the
issue during the embargo period.

At the end of the embargo period, maintainers will publicly release information
about the security issue together with the CIAB patches that mitigate it.
